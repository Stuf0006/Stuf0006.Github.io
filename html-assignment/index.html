    <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p>My name is Michael Acquah Stuff, born on the 6<sup>th</sup> of May 1988. I currently reside at 182 B Woodridge Crescent, with a postal code of K2B 7S9. I'm married and blessed with two wonderful children. With nine years of professional experience, I've navigated the realms of Information Technology and Management Information Systems with fervor and dedication. My journey began with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University for Development Studies, Navrongo, in 2013, followed by a stint at the Ghana-India Kofi Annan Centre of Excellence in <abbr title="Information Communication Technology">ICT,</abbr> where I attained my <abbr title="Cisco Certified Network Associate">CCNA</abbr> certification in 2014.</p>
       <p>In 2015 to 2023, I served as a Senior Management Information System Officer at Nationwide Medical Insurance, where my duties spanned network security, database management, software development, and IT infrastructure maintenance. From providing IT support during my tenure at Dean Academy to managing network installations at Multi Innovative Center for Excellence, my career journey has been enriched with diverse experiences, honing my technical prowess and fostering leadership skills. My dedication, problem-solving abilities, and passion for technology have been the driving forces behind my professional journey, enabling me to contribute meaningfully to every role I undertake. I am currently in Canada and studying Interactive Media Design at Algonquin college.</p>
